            <span class="paragraphs"><p> <span id="MinMount">M</span>ount Bromo is probably one of the most famous
            scenic attraction in East Java of Indonesia. It is famous for its magnificent sunrise views and view of volcano crater there, which is very rare to see. That
            goes well for Kawah Ijen Volcano Crater.</p>

            <p>Bromo is still oe of the most active volcanoes in the world and there are areas that are blocked off from tourists due to its imminent danger. Because of that, mount Bromo was automatically on my bucket list to be checked off when I was visiting Indonesia.</p>

            <p>My starting point was in Bali and I had to take a bus from Ubung Bus Terminal to Probolinggo for the first leg of the trip.</p>

            <p>In the early morning of Ubung Bus Terminal, there wasn't any ticket window and I would have to negotiate with the bus representatives swarming around the bus terminal trying to sell you bus tickets. One thing you need to note: No toilet breaks. However you can use the toilets at the ferry. The bus will take the ferry across, reducing the hassle of buying separate ferry tickets. You can buy food on the ferry as well.

        <span id="paragraphs"><p>When I hopped off the bus at the terminal in Probolinggo, everything was dark. The streets were empty except for a few police officers walking around. I was actually deserted on the streets for around two hours or so. Only untill this guy on a motorcycle came out of thin air and stopped me to offer me a ride to the Mount Bromo as he was on his way there.</p>

        <p>This is only the beginning of the hike to Mount Bromo, but the motorcycle driver rode me through the base of Bromo before I started hiking up the volcano to the summit. Often tourists would take a jeep to get to the base of the Bromo and I saw plenty of them passing my ride while I get to enjoy and absorb the scenery I had while riding. No regrets here.</p>

        <p>There were high winds when I was there. It was so early, I could see the mist and fog all over the area. The sun was still rising from the ground.</p>


            <blockquote id="blockquoteIndonesia"> <p> Before planning to go to Indonesia, I had never even heared of Mount Bromo. Perhaps I had seen a photograph of it somewhere without knowing what is was.</p> </blockquote>

        <p> I had to walk up a steep, windy path, but then I took the risk to go on a danerous off-path to beat the slow people walking up the path. The off-path was somewhat easier because I wasn't walking on the path where horses tend to walk and pass me. The sand was too soft, so it became exhausting to walk on it upwards. So, the path I took had more solid surface where it was more comfortable for me to hike up at my own pace. Besides, I was lucky to have excellent hking boots</p>

        <p>Due to high altitude, it became harder to breath as I go up. I was panting like a dog when I got at the top. It was quite challenging even for someone as fit as me. The views from the top were gorgeous, although still very dangerous.</p></span>

        <p>Then I took the stairway to the crater acidic lake nearby and there was a path around the crater, so I took a walk around the crater to absorb the breezing environment.</p>

        <span id="floatp"><p>The people I met at the top of summit were so friendly and they interacted with me. we all shared a moment together there. Everybody also helped each other out by taking pictures of each other. Not only that, some locals were there and they offered us fresh fruits and some food. I was in awe of them, but I had to decline because I didn't want to spend much. It was pleasing to be there.</p>

            <p>The evironment was so breezing and beautiful with clouds and white smoke coming out of Mount Bromo. I couldn't see the lava because of that, but the view was beyond stunning, I wouldn't replace anything witht his experience.</p></span>
